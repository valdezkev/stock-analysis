# VBA Challenge

## Overview of Project 
### The purpose of this project was to create code for Steve that would allow him to run analysis on the stock market. Specifically, for the years 2017 and 2018 and also for only certain stocks. He wanted a simple way to show his parents the return values of them with a hit of a button.

### Refacotoring the code had some interesting results. In the refactored version the amount of time the code ran was longer than in the original code, as you can see in the photos. 

## Summary
### I think some of the disadvantages of refacotring your code is that maybe you could accidentally ruin the code, which is not the end of the world because you still have your original so you can always go back and fix what was messed up. On the other hand, a pro is that you could go and make it look better at the end and add backgrounds or change fonts instead of having to do it in the beggining. 
### This applies to the original VBA scfipt because in the refactored version of our code there was new formatting that could help the worksheet look more pleasing.
